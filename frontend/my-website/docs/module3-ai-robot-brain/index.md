# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

This module focuses on leveraging the NVIDIA Isaac platform to develop the AI brain for humanoid robots. Students will learn about Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation, which is crucial for training robust perception models without extensive real-world data collection. The module will also cover Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) and Nav2 for advanced path-planning, specifically tailored for bipedal movement in humanoid systems.

## Topics Covered

- NVIDIA Isaac platform overview
- Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS for VSLAM
- Nav2 for bipedal path-planning
- Hardware acceleration for AI in robotics

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the capabilities of the NVIDIA Isaac platform.
- Be able to generate synthetic datasets for robotic perception.
- Implement VSLAM using Isaac ROS.
- Develop and apply Nav2 for humanoid robot locomotion.
