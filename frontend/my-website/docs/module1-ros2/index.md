# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the foundational middleware for developing robotic applications. Students will learn about ROS 2 architecture, key communication concepts like nodes, topics, services, and actions, and how to build Python-based ROS 2 packages. The module will also cover the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) for modeling humanoid robots.

## Topics Covered

- ROS 2 core concepts
- Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions
- `rclpy` for Python ROS 2 development
- Building ROS 2 packages
- URDF for robot modeling

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the ROS 2 ecosystem and its role in robotics.
- Be able to implement ROS 2 communication patterns.
- Develop Python ROS 2 packages.
- Create URDF models for humanoid robots.
